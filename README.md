	ROUND(
	(population * 0.25)/1000000, 
	2) as coffee_consumers_in_millions,
	city_rank
FROM city
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```


2. **Total Revenue from Coffee Sales**  
   What is the total revenue generated from coffee sales across all cities in the last quarter of 2023?
```
SELECT 
	SUM(total) as total_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)  = 2023
	AND
	EXTRACT(quarter FROM sale_date) = 4



SELECT 
	ci.city_name,
	SUM(s.total) as total_revenue
FROM sales as s
JOIN customers as c
ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN city as ci
ON ci.city_id = c.city_id
WHERE 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.sale_date)  = 2023
	AND
	EXTRACT(quarter FROM s.sale_date) = 4
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

3. **Sales Count for Each Product**  
   How many units of each coffee product have been sold?
```
SELECT 
	p.product_name,
	COUNT(s.sale_id) as total_orders
FROM products as p
LEFT JOIN
sales as s
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
4. **Average Sales Amount per City**  
   What is the average sales amount per customer in each city?
```
SELECT 
	ci.city_name,
	SUM(s.total) as total_revenue,

	ROUND(
			SUM(s.total)/
				COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id)
			,2) as avg_sale_pr_cx
	
FROM sales as s
JOIN customers as c
ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN city as ci
ON ci.city_id = c.city_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

```
WITH city_table as 
(

	FROM city
),
customers_table
AS
(
	SELECT 
		ci.city_name,
		COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) as unique_cx
	FROM sales as s
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
	JOIN city as ci
	ON ci.city_id = c.city_id
	GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	customers_table.city_name,
	city_table.coffee_consumers as coffee_consumer_in_millions,
	customers_table.unique_cx
FROM city_table
JOIN 
customers_table
